693	[{'id': 9648, 'name': 'Mystery'}, {'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}, {'id': 35, 'name': 'Comedy'}]		2012-05-13	8x23	Desperate Housewives	"Desperate Housewives is an American television comedy-drama-mystery series created by Marc Cherry and produced by ABC Studios and Cherry Productions. It aired Sundays at 9 P.M. Eastern/8 P.M. Central, on ABC from October 3, 2004, until May 13, 2012. Executive producer Cherry served as showrunner. Other executive producers since the fourth season included Bob Daily, George W. Perkins, John Pardee, Joey Murphy, David Grossman, and Larry Shaw.

The main setting of the show was Wisteria Lane, a street in the fictional American town of 'Fairview' in the fictional 'Eagle State'. The show followed the lives of a group of women as seen through the eyes of a dead neighbor who committed suicide in the very first episode. The storyline covers thirteen years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017. They worked through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their — at the surface — beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.

The show featured an ensemble cast, headed by Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, and Eva Longoria as Gabrielle Solis. Brenda Strong narrated the show as the deceased Mary Alice Young, appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences."	180.0	8	693	
3933	[]				Desperately Seeking Something	"Desperately Seeking Something is a British television series first broadcast on 6 November 1995, presented by travel writer and presenter Pete McCarthy. In it, McCarthy looked at various spiritual practices from across the globe, and meeting their practitioners. It ran for three series. The third series involved him looking at world traditional beliefs like Australian Aboriginal beliefs and Hawaiian religion. The second season looked more at Christian and Pagan sects, including the Fellowship of Isis and the Golden Dawn.

Before going on what would be referred to as a ""spiritual journey"", McCarthy said ""I've taken on the role of everyman, I'm like lots of people who have given up religion and never replaced it with anything else."""	0.0	0	3933

42214	[{'id': 18, 'name': 'Drama'}]		2011-12-26	1x5	Desperate Scousewives	"Desperate Scousewives was a British reality television series based in Liverpool. It premiered on E4 at 10:00pm on 28 November 2011. It ran for eight episodes before it was officially announced that the show had been cancelled due to stagnating ratings and a perceived lack of interest in cast members from viewers. The show gained favourable viewing figures for its first episode debuting with 500,000 viewers, 24% up on the E4 channel's slot average. However, episodes for the rest of the series were regularly below this figure and outside of the E4 Top 10 weekly rankings.

The show's name is a play on words of the American comedy-drama Desperate Housewives and was said to be ""Liverpool's answer to The Only Way Is Essex and Made in Chelsea"". Repeats began airing on 4Music from 26 April 2012, sparking speculation from cast members that it may be a test run to recommission a new series on 4Music instead of E4. However, E4 reaffirmed their decision several times about the show's cancellation via their official Twitter page despite cast members continually claiming that a second series is in production."	8.0	1	42214	
47354	[]		1992-05-05	9x1	Abortion: Desperate Choices	An intensely personal exploration of an explosive issue -- abortion in America. Wrenching first-person narratives from seven decades of women, each one facing an unplanned pregnancy -- and the dreadful decision that no one wants to make. Both pro-life and pro-choice, both out front on the picket line and inside the clinic, these women's stories turn politics into heart-searing drama: a pregnant 17-year-old and her pro-life mother whose conflict unfolds in front of the camera; a 22-year-old who became a pro-life protester when she learned that her mother nearly aborted her; an unhappy mother-of-two who's expecting a third when her marriage suddenly hits the rocks; a 71-year-old grandmother who still grieves for her mother, an early victim of illegal abortion. In this fusion of past and present, the history of abortion is the history of women -- told at a time in America when yesterday's back-alley abortions may be the only choice left for tomorrow.	1.0	1	47354
